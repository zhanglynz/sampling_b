# Preface {-}

No matter what we want to study/learn, in my opinion---probably you agree with me---**understanding** is the most important goal that we want to archive. For understanding, we focus our attention on *what*, *how* and *why*, with unequal emphasis, depending on circumstances. A good starting point of learning about *survey sampling* is a couple of what questions:

- What is a *sample*?
- What is a good sample?

We cover these questions especially the answers to them in Chapter \@ref(sample).
