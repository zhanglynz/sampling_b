For understanding, we focus our attention on what, how and why, with unequal emphasis, depending on circumstances. A good starting point of learning about survey sampling is a couple of what questions: What is a sample? What is a good sample? We cover these questions especially the answers to them in Chapter 1.

The question in the title is easy to answer: A sample is a subset of a population. Now, what is a population? Well, a population is defined in the planning stage of a study and is determined by study objectives.We can visualize a population using the following table: Member/Item ID Var\\(_1\\) Var\\(_2\\) \\(\\cdots\\) Var\\(_m\\) 1 2 \\(\\vdots\\) \\(N\\) So essentially a population is a list of members/items with associated characteristic variables that are of interest to the study. However, when it comes to the fine details in the population concept, things are kind of complicated. Following Lohr (2019), we distinguish three populations, namely, target population, sampling frame population and sampled population; see Figure X. Insert a figure here. Lets have an example. Target population: all private dwellings in New Zealand. Sampling frame population: address list purchased from New Zealand Post. Not eligible for survey: some non-private dwellings, e.g. a prison. Not included in sampling frame: some new private dwellings not included in NZ Post system. 1.2 What is a good sample? 1.3 On sampling error "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
