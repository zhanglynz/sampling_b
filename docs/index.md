# Preface {-}

How do you learn, or to be exact, how do you learn complex stuff? I guess that many different answers will come up, because we are all different in many aspects, such as culture background, knowledge level, and learning style etc. etc.. For myself, if I want to seriously learn some complex stuff, then I will write about it. Without doubts, *sampling* (or more exactly, *survey sampling*) is complex, and it is kind of boring^[A little story told by Nan Laird in Ryan (2015): "We were informed that since it was Cochran's
last year of teaching at Harvard, we had to take all his
courses straightaway. So we took Sample Surveys and
Design of Experiments. I recall that the first day of
class in Sample Surveys, Cochran stood at the board
and said (in a kind of indistinct mumble) that this was
the most boring topic in the world and he could not
imagine why anyone would take the class." For those who are interested in Cochran, please read this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gemmell_Cochran).], but it is important (for me, because I need the knowledge/skills at my work, and for you the reasons may be different). So I have to learn and re-learn sampling, and this results in the current book.

No matter what we study/learn, in my opinion---probably you agree with me---**understanding** is the most important goal that we want to achieve. For understanding, we must focus our attention on **what**, **how** and **why**, with unequal emphasis, depending on circumstances. A good starting point of learning about survey sampling is a couple of what questions:

- What is a *sample*?
- What is a good sample?
<!-- - Why take a sample? -->

We cover these questions especially the answers to them in Chapter \@ref(sample).
